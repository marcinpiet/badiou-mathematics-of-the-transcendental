# Mathematics of the Transcendental - Reading Notes

This repository is for notes and code experiments related to Alain Badiou's "Mathematics of the Transcendental".

## Code Experiments

This repository contains Haskell code to experiment with the concepts presented in the book. Each Haskell file is devoted to a separate chapter and is titled like the chapter (e.g., `Preliminary Definitions.hs`).
